# AWS-Cloud-Projects
Lab Objective:  

How I Implemented a Scalable, Highly Available Website in AWS 
 

Objective: 
I design, deploy, and validate a scalable, highly available, and secure web application using core AWS services. This lab aims to simulate real-world cloud architecture that ensures performance, reliability, and fault tolerance using AWS best practices. 
 
The Outcomes: 
By the end of this project, I was able to: 
•	Provision EC2 instances to serve web content. 
•	Configure Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) for distributing incoming traffic. 
•	Set up Auto Scaling Groups to dynamically adjust capacity based on demand. 
•	Implement a highly available database using Amazon Dynamo DB (Multi-AZ)  
•	Configure Route 53 for domain name resolution and routing policies. 
•	Apply security best practices using Security Groups, IAM roles, and AWS WAF/Shield. 
•	Monitor system performance using Amazon CloudWatch and configure alerting. 
•	Test fault tolerance by simulating instance or AZ failures. 
  
Core AWS Services that I Used: 
•	Compute: Amazon EC2 with Auto Scaling 
•	Load Balancing: Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) 
•	Database: Dynamo DB (Multi-AZ) or Aurora 
•	DNS & Traffic Routing: Amazon Route 53 
•	Security: Security Groups, IAM, AWS WAF, AWS Shield 
•	Monitoring: Amazon CloudWatch (logs, alarms, dashboards) 
  
     Lab Tasks Overview: 
1.	Launch a basic EC2 web server in one Availability Zone. 
2.	Register and configure a domain in Route 53. 
3.	Deploy a Load Balancer in front of EC2 instances. 
4.	Set up Auto Scaling based on CPU utilization. 
5.	Launch a multi-AZ Dynamo DB database for backend storage. 
6.	Apply Security Groups and IAM roles for secure access. 
7.	Enable WAF/Shield to protect against common web threats. 
8.	Use CloudWatch to monitor metrics and set alerts. 
9.	Perform failure testing by terminating instances or disabling AZs to verify HA. 
  
Deliverables: 
•	Deployed infrastructure (web app + Dynao DB + CDN + Auto-scaling). 
•	Screenshots of each step and CloudWatch metrics. 
•	Written summary/report explaining each AWS component used and its role. 
•	Fault tolerance test results.
